Double implementation of stack means using a single array to store two stacks.

1.In case of static implementaion
  
   ->We take a array of fixed size 'n'.Now we will take two top pointers i.e top1 and top2.
   ->top1 will start from starting of array and will be initialized with -1.
   ->top2 will start from end of array and will be initialized with 'n'.
   ->OverFlow condition will be top1+1 == top2.

2.In case of dynamic Implementatiom
  
   ->We take a dynamic array of initial size 'n'.Now we will take two top pointers i.e top1 and top2.
   ->top1 will start from starting of array and will be initialized with -1.
   ->top2 will start from end of array and will be initialized with 'n'.
   ->In this case also the overflow condition will be top1+1 == top2.But in this we can resize the array.
