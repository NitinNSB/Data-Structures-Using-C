## A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

## In queue One end is for insertion and another One is for deletion.

## In this you can only see the last and first element i.e only rear and front.

- Front: the index where the first element is stored in the array representing the queue.
- Rear: the index where the last element is stored in an array representing the queue.

- Jaisai too school mai line mai lagta tha,toh jo sabsai phalai aata tha vo line mai sabsai phalai(front) lagta tha or baki sab pichai(rear) lagtai jatai thai.Or prayer khatam honai kai badd sabsai phalai agai wala niklta tha then usskai pichai wla and soo onn.Toh same ishi tarai queue mai bhi insertion rear(pichai) hoga or deletion agai(front) sai hoga.
